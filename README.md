# IS3205 Object Oriented Programming Practical Video

In this practical videos, we are covering how to implement a pirate game while covering some concepts in Object Oriented Programming. The pirate game will have a simple map (as a two-dimensional array) and then some objects will be added to the map. Pirates will move around the map.

The main focus was to create an Application Programming Interface (API) for the pirate game while testing them through console. Then implementing them into a basic graphical user interface application to interact that make use of API.
